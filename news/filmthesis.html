    <h2 class="int">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Action cinema, characterized by intense scenes of violence, fights, chases, and armed conflict, <br>
        has been a popular genre among adolescents for decades. Since this stage of human development <br>
        is critical in shaping identity, behavior, and emotional structure, there is growing concern <br>
        about the real impact of such content. This research aims to analyze whether constant exposure <br>
        to action films significantly influences the psychological, emotional, or behavioral development <br>
        of adolescents, based on psychiatric and psychological evidence suggesting that such an impact does exist.

    <h2 class="stat">Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Exposure to violent audiovisual media has been the subject of numerous studies in psychology and psychiatry. <br> 
        While in many cases it is argued that adolescents can differentiate fiction from reality, other studies <br>
        indicate that such exposure can alter their emotional responses, increase tolerance to violence, and even <br>
        influence interpersonal relationships and behavior. Therefore, the central question arises: To what extent <br> 
        can action films disrupt the healthy development of adolescents?

<article class="justification" id="justification">
    <h2 class="just">Justification</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding the effect of action cinema on adolescent development is essential for parents, educators, and policymakers. <br>
        This research provides a critical review based on scientific evidence to determine whether this film genre is a factor that <br>
        negatively influences personality formation, conflict resolution, and empathy in young people.

    <h2 class="obj">Objectives</h2>
    <p>
        General Objective: <br>
    To determine whether frequent consumption of action films affects the psychological and emotional development of adolescents. <br>
    <br>
    Specific Objectives: <br>
    <br>
    Analyze psychiatric and psychological evidence on the effects of audiovisual violence on adolescent development. <br>
    Identify behaviors associated with excessive consumption of violent cinema. <br>
    Contrast scientific studies with popular perceptions on the topic.

<article class="hypothesis" id="hypothesis">
    <h2 class="hyp">Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>
        Main Hypothesis: <br> 
    <br>
    Regular consumption of action films negatively influences the emotional and behavioral development of adolescents.
    </p>

    <h2 class="theo">Theoretical Framework</h2>
    <p>
        Various studies in psychiatry and neuroscience have shown that adolescents, being in a stage of neurological development, <br> 
        are more sensitive to external stimuli. Psychiatrist Daniel Siegel argues that the prefrontal cortex <br>
        is still maturing during adolescence, which affects judgment and impulse control. Joseph LeDoux explains that repeated exposure <br> 
        to violence can continuously activate the amygdala, leading to a prolonged state of alert. <br>
        <br>
        Studies by Dr. Craig Anderson have linked constant exposure to violent media with increased aggression, <br>
        reduced empathy, and normalization of violence. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has warned about <br>
        the risks of emotional desensitization in youth who regularly consume such content. <br>
        Additionally, research in developmental psychology suggests that contextual factors such as family and social environments <br>
        can modulate these effects, making it crucial to consider these variables in analysis. <br>
    </p>

<article class="methodology" id="methodology">
    <h2 class="meth">Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        This study is based on a documentary review of scientific and medical sources specializing in developmental psychology, <br>
        child psychiatry, and neuroscience. More than ten peer-reviewed studies published between 2005 and 2023 were analyzed. <br>
        The research focuses on adolescents aged 12 to 18 who are regular consumers of action films. <br>
        Additionally, a comparative analysis of cases in different educational contexts was conducted to achieve data <br>
        triangulation that strengthens the validity and reliability of the results. <br>
    </p>
</article>
<article class="analysis" id="analysis">
    <h2 class="anal">Analysis and Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        The review of studies suggests that while action films are not a direct cause of emotional or behavioral disorders, <br> 
        they can act as a reinforcing factor for preexisting problematic behaviors or foster aggressive attitudes. <br>
        Adolescents frequently exposed to violent content show higher tolerance to aggression, lower empathetic capacity, <br>
        and in some cases, imitation of impulsive behaviors. It is important to note that, beyond these effects, <br>
        variables such as family environment, educational level, and social context play a fundamental role in how such behaviors manifest. <br> 
        This implies that the impact can vary significantly from case to case, presenting a real risk for certain more vulnerable groups. <br>

<article class="conclusions" id="conclusions">
    <h2 class="concl">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
        Action films can negatively affect the emotional and behavioral development of adolescents, especially when consumed excessively <br>
        and without proper guidance. <br> 
        Scientific evidence supports the idea that repeated exposure to audiovisual violence contributes to emotional desensitization <br>
        and the normalization of aggression. <br>
        It is crucial for parents, guardians, and educators to promote a critical and moderate consumption of audiovisual content, <br> 
        accompanied by dialogue and specific guidance to help mitigate potential negative effects. <br>
        It is recommended to implement mediation strategies and media literacy education in schools to counteract and reduce <br> 
        adverse effects on youth development.
