    <h2>What is CRISPR</h2>
            <P>
                CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a revolutionary tool <br>
                that allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA. Originally discovered as part of a bacterial defense system, <br>
                CRISPR has become a powerful method for gene editing, enabling targeted modifications in plants, <br>
                animals, and even humans.

            <h2>The Controversial Experiment</h2>
            <p>
                In late 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui shocked the global scientific community by announcing the birth of the world’s <br>
                first genetically modified babies. Using a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR-Cas9, <br>
                Jiankui claimed to have altered the DNA of twin girls to make them resistant to HIV. <br>
                <br>

                The announcement sparked intense ethical, scientific, and legal debates that still echo today. <br>
                Jiankui’s experiment aimed to disable a gene called CCR5, which allows HIV to enter human cells. <br>
                By editing this gene in embryos, he attempted to create HIV-resistant humans. The embryos were then implanted, <br> 
                and the resulting birth of the twins, Lulu and Nana, marked the first known case of germline genetic <br>
                modification in humans. <br>
                This type of editing is particularly controversial because it affects every cell in the body, <br>
                including future generations.
            </p>
            <h3> Global Reaction</h3>
            <p>
                The event triggered widespread debate about the regulation of genetic technologies. <br>
                Countries like the U.S., U.K., and members of the EU have banned or strictly regulated human germline editing. <br>
                Meanwhile, international organizations have called for a global moratorium on the clinical use of CRISPR <br>
                for heritable human editing.
            </p>
            <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
            <p>
                Today, scientists continue to explore CRISPR’s potential in medicine, especially for diseases like sickle cell anemia, <br> 
                cancer, and rare genetic disorders. However, most researchers agree that editing embryos for non-therapeutic <br>
                purposes—like enhancing intelligence or physical traits—remains ethically unacceptable.

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                CRISPR is one of the most transformative scientific tools of our time. But with great power comes great responsibility. <br> 
                The case of the genetically modified babies stands as a powerful reminder that science must advance <br>
                hand in hand with ethics, law, and public dialogue.
